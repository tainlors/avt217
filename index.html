    <p>A: I can't think of one, so I'll say Pre Viszla from The Clone Wars. He was very evil and he was for the right cause but went about it in the worst way possible.</p>

    <h2>Question 15</h2>
    <p>Q: Who is your favorite music artist and why?</p>

    <p>Q: What inspired you to apply to George Mason University and the field of study you selected?</p>
